                    <div></br></div>
                    <p class="h5">As we already stated the current state of the 
                        application is not the final one. We have scheduled more 
                        features both long and short term. We expect from our 
                        application handle more modules beside the three existing one.
                    </p>
                    <div></br></div>
                    <p class="h5">We are planning to release a new module that will
                        take care of the warehouses that will be implied in logistic part.
                        The warehouse module will have the same functionality as 
                        the other modules except that we will have to handle cargo
                        by how fragile and how long it will last. This also means
                        there will exist some changes in how the client will declare
                        their cargo, so probably shipment module will be changed as well.
                    </p>
                    <div></br></div>
                    <p class="h5">Another feature that seems important to us is a chat.
                        Using a chat we can talk to our customers in real time, discussing
                        all the changes that appeared in the last moment.This 
                        chat will also be an important tool that will help us 
                        get a direct feedback from our customer.  
                    </p>
                    <div></br></div>
                    <p class="h5">On short term, these would be all the important 
                    changes for us but as we already stated there are more that 
                    will appear in long term.We thing that we might open a transport
                    company in the future.</p>
